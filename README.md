# Web-Based Database Viewer

* This clone was originally created in 2004 by Muuss of our Emulator community, I've since gone through and cleaned quite a few things up but it still could use a complete rewrite as the internals are terrible to work with but this is an ancient PHP app and much has changed since
* If you are interested in using this for your server, it is plenty functional and below is the instructions to do so

### Setup

* Clone this repository into a webserver directory and then make a copy of the config file in `includes`

```cp includes/config.template.php includes/config.php```

* You will need to set your database variables and most importantly your site URL

### Developing Using Docker

* We have a docker environment ready to go, on Linux/Mac environments there are helper scripts that you can run
* We're using the following services in this docker stack
  * nginx
  * php-fpm 7.2
  * mariadb
* You will need to first go to the `laradock` folder and copy the example env config 

```cp env-example .env```

* Then you can proceed below

### Starting the docker environment

```./docker-up.sh```

Or

```cd laradock && docker-compose up -d nginx mariadb workspace && cd ..```

### Stopping the docker environment

```./docker-down.sh```

Or

```cd laradock && docker-compose down && cd ..```

### Development Database 

* If you already have a database to point to, you can simply use whatever database server you'd like in your config and you 
can simply start the nginx container via `docker-compose up -d nginx workspace` while you are in the `laradock` folder

* Assuming you are using the laradock setup mentioned above, you will need to source in a database, we've provided a handy
script to do just that

* From the `laradock` directory run:

```docker-compose exec workspace php seed-db.php```

* At this point you should have all data sourced into your docker database environment and you should be able to connect without issue. The stock config template should work out of the box for the docker development environment
